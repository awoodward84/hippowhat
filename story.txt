I sat in my Audi, turned up the Musik, turned on the Klimaanlage, and headed out to the Flughafen so I could fly to the Berlin. 
While heading there, I pulled up next to a BMW and began to get wettbewerbsfaehig to see who had the faster vehicle. 
I cranked the Rammstein musik up so all the ladies would think he was pretty fly for a white guy.
I noticed a beautiful Frau wearing a short Dirndel and hit the breaks immediately. 
My tires made a loud screetch, as I had just missed a hund that ran across the street. 
I stopped by a Frankische Bratwurst stand on the corner of Munich street to befriedige meinen hunger.
The Bratwurst hit caused sparks to fly like a piece of copper flying through a Gauss field.
I thought a beer would go well with the brot, so I took a trip down the Hauptstrasse to the local Ratskeller.
About a block passed Munich street I came across a group of Bavarians wearing Lederhosens and der Kellner's close by their side.
They were just leaving a Baeckerei where they fought with a another group over a loaf of marble rye.
They fought a lot for the brot, and amongst the group vying for the rye I saw a Mehlhase!  
I decided the brot was not a necessity and screamed, Das ist mir Wurst!
The Bavarian closest to me was holding a box of gebaeck, which I yoinked from his hands!
The Bavarian turned out to be pretty wettbewerbsfaehig and snached the gebaeck back from me, all the while his hund snarrled.
